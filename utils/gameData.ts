I'm your AI Senior Doctor mentor. I'll help you practice diagnosing virtual patients.

ðŸŽ¯ Scoring System:
â€¢ Each case has 10 possible points (5 for tests + 5 for diagnosis)
â€¢ -2 points per extra attempt
â€¢ 0 points for contra-indicated tests
â€¢ Perfect first-try score: 10 points! 

Type "start" or "new case" to begin a new case.
Type "help" for instructions.
Type "quit" to end the session.`;

export const helpMessage = `ðŸŽ® Game Instructions:
1. Type "start" or "new case" to begin
2. I'll present a patient case
3. First, suggest what tests you'd recommend
4. Then, based on the results, provide your diagnosis
5. I'll give you feedback and explain the correct approach
6. Type "new case" for another patient
7. Type "quit" to end the session

ðŸ“Š Scoring:
â€¢ Test selection: 5 points (âˆ’2 per extra try)
â€¢ Diagnosis: 5 points (âˆ’2 per extra try)
â€¢ Contra-indicated tests: 0 points
â€¢ Perfect score per case: 10 points

Remember: Think carefully about each case and explain your reasoning!`;
